Gitam Resource Hub

Gitam Resource Hub is a simple web-based platform created to help students easily access course-related study materials from a single place.

The project was built to address a common problem among students: difficulty in finding organized and reliable resources for each subject during the semester.

Motivation

Students often rely on scattered links, forwarded messages, or multiple drives to find:

Syllabus documents

Notes and reference materials

Important questions and exam resources

This leads to confusion, duplication, and wasted time.
The goal of this project is to provide a clear, centralized entry point for academic resources.

Features (V1)

Course-wise organization of materials

One-click access to subject resources

Design Choices
Storage

The initial version uses Google Drive folders for storage.

This decision was made to:

Avoid authentication and infrastructure overhead

Allow quick deployment and easy access for students

The focus of V1 is usability and stability rather than backend complexity.
