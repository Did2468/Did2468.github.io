Gitam Resource Hub was created to help students easily access course-related study materials from a single, organized place. Many students face difficulty finding reliable resources for each subject, especially during the semester, due to scattered links and inconsistent sharing. This project is intended for students who want quick, view-and-download access to syllabus documents, notes, and important study materials without any friction. The initial version focuses on simplicity, usability, and reliability, with plans to evolve into a more structured and backend-driven system in the future.
